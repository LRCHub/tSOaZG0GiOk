[00:49.44] Don't test, them bullets might press
[00:54.08] Why they wanna see me dead? I ain't even grown yet
[00:58.90] Baby, you got too much to offer
[01:02.38] That's prolly why they want you in a coffin

[01:44.32] But you never know when you gotta go
[01:52.14] Sometimes I can't wait
[02:03.14]
